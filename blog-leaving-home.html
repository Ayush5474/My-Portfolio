        <h1>The Cost of Leaving Home</h1>
        <p class="meta">By Ayush Gunjal | Thoughts on Growth</p>
    </header>

    <article class="content">
        <p>When I moved to another city, I carried a vision—to inspire myself, make my parents proud, reach people with my work, earn good money, eat great food, and live the life I had dreamed of as a child. <strong>But what happens after you finally make that move?</strong></p>

        <p>The problem with leaving your hometown isn’t just about relocating. It’s about leaving behind the love and comfort you once took for granted. The moment you step into a new city, everything familiar turns into the unknown—the warmth of home, the company of family and friends, the temples you visited, the streets you wandered at night, the lazy afternoons you spent doing nothing, the pets you adored, the trees you planted, the room you built with your own hands, and even the art that once defined you.</p>

        <p>At first, you believe you’re chasing a dream. But soon, reality sinks in. You find yourself struggling every single day, leaving behind pieces of who you were. The focus shifts from passion to survival, from dreams to responsibilities. You tell yourself that one day, everything will be perfect—but you don’t know when, how, or where that day will come.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "The happiness I once knew slowly turned into sadness. The pursuit of money didn’t bring joy, and the things that once gave my life meaning began to fade away."
        </blockquote>

        <p>I moved to this city with the hope of transforming my life. Yet, I found myself experiencing the exact opposite. My love for photography? Lost. My hobby of reading? Forgotten. The artist in me, who once created something new every day and craved knowledge? Drowned in the noise of survival.</p>

        <p>I kept trying to fit into this new reality—a world where politics mattered more than skills, where creativity was overshadowed by practicality. It consumed me. And then came the questions from my parents:</p>
        
        <p style="color: #fff; padding-left: 20px; border-left: 2px solid #555;">
            "What is happening? You keep moving forward, but nothing seems to change. What exactly is changing?"
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>The answer was simple yet painful—<strong>the way I was changing. My path was changing.</strong></p>

        <p>At this point, I truly understood what it meant to be an artist. When you strip away hierarchies, titles, and social norms, all that remains is you—your passion, your creativity, and your relentless drive to imagine something beyond the ordinary.</p>

        <p>Life demands sacrifices. To gain something, you must leave something behind. It’s a truth I despise, yet it exists to bring balance.</p>

        <p>It took me more than four months to learn how to live in this new city. At first, my mind resisted, clinging to the comfort of the past. But eventually, my body and soul adjusted, whispering, <em>"This is your new norm. Adapt. Move forward."</em> And just like that, the way I once lived in my hometown became a distant memory, fading day by day.</p>

        <p>The world is full of motivational speakers telling you, "Don't give up." But the truth is, you can’t give up, even if you wanted to. This is life. Many people today dream of leaving everything behind, moving to a small town, living peacefully with family and friends, and simply being happy. And maybe, just maybe, that is what true life should be.</p>

        <p>But no matter where you are or what your life looks like, one truth remains: <br>
        <span class="highlight">Whatever comes your way, face it, fix it, make it better. That’s how you learn.</span></p>

        <p>Struggles aren’t just obstacles—they shape you. The hardships you endure callous your mind, making it stronger, sharpening your resilience. This is the way of life in the struggle phase.</p>

        <p>So no matter how challenging this journey gets, I have realized one thing—you must face your struggles, fix what’s broken, and keep moving forward. This is the only way to survive in the corporate jungle.</p>

        <p>Perfection doesn’t exist. You don’t find happiness—you create it. Stop focusing on your weaknesses; they are simply the starting points of your strength. Be grateful for them. Keep smiling. Keep reminding yourself:</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 40px; color: var(--primary);">This is not going to be perfect. You have to make it perfect.</h3>
